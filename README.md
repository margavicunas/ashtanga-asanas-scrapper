# Ashtanga Primary Series Scraper üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A Python scraper that collects and organizes images and names of asanas from the Ashtanga Yoga Primary Series. This tool helps practitioners and teachers easily access a comprehensive collection of asana references.

## Purpose

This project was created to compile a structured dataset of Ashtanga Primary Series asanas, making it easier to:
- Reference asana names and their corresponding images
- Study the sequence offline
- Have a local backup of the asana references

## Features

- Downloads all asana images from the primary series
- Creates a structured JSON file with asana names and image paths
- Handles image format conversion automatically
- Includes proper error handling and logging

    "img": "/path/to/image.png"
  }
]
```

## Development

- Proper logging for debugging
